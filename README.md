# Art Hunter

Art Hunter was a Culturathon in partnership with the Louvre-Lens VallÃ©e and 3ZA Engineering.

> Our goal was to build a website to help visiotors to understand the works of art in a museum.

> Our idea was to gamify the discovery of works of art by implementing a catalog whose works were unlocked once the user found himself near the work.

**The project is built with Symfony, PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.**
